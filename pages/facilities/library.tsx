              Library can be considered a store – house of knowledge. In
              dictionaries the word “library” has been defined as “a building or
              room containing a collection of books”. A well-stocked library is
              an positive feature to the college. A library has a librarian to
              guide and attend to the readers. A library is a place where not
              only books but also journals, magazines and newspapers are
              well-stocked for the benefit of the readers. It helps the spread
              of education. The library is a boon for poor students who cannot
              afford to buy text books or other books of their interest. They
              can borrow these books and read or study them at ease at home. A
              library is thus a help to the society. The mission of the college
              library is to facilitate creation of new knowledge through
              acquisition, organisation and dissemination of knowledge resources
              and provide value added services. It has an excellent collection
              of books,journals, periodicals, CDs and non book materials in the
              field of science and technology and general books etc.
